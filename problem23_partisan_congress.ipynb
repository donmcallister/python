    "Each exercise builds on the previous one. However, they may be completed independently. That is, if you can't complete an exercise, we provide some code that can run to load precomputed results for the next exercise. That way, you can keep moving even if you get stuck.\n",

    "- If your program behavior seem strange, try resetting the kernel and rerunning everything.\n",
    "- If you mess up this notebook or just want to start from scratch, save copies of all your partial responses and use `Actions` $\\rightarrow$ `Reset Assignment` to get a fresh, original copy of this notebook. _(Resetting will wipe out any answers you've written so far, so be sure to stash those somewhere safe if you intend to keep or reuse them!)_\n",
    "- If you generate excessive output (e.g., from an ill-placed `print` statement) that causes the notebook to load slowly or not at all, use `Actions` $\\rightarrow$ `Clear Notebook Output` to get a clean copy. The clean copy will retain your code but remove any generated output. **However**, it will also **rename** the notebook to `clean.xxx.ipynb`. Since the autograder expects a notebook file with the original name, you'll need to rename the clean notebook accordingly.\n",
